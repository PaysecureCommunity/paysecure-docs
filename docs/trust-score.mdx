# Fundstream TrustScore API

## Overview

Fundstream TrustScore's proprietary API combines email, phone number, IP, and URL so that you can request and receive a user trust score from our enriched data, rules, and scoring in a single API call.

Our take on Trust is different from the usual approach to fraud. This API tells you how much you can trust this user. Itâ€™s based on 100+ data points to which we have access. We use complex algorithms based on data sanity and customer behavior in our partner network.

## Trust Score & Usage

Fundstream offers two distinct endpoints: General and Detailed.

- **General Endpoint:** Provides basic information by indicating whether a transaction is permitted or not with a simple 'yes' or 'no' response.
- **Detailed Endpoint:** Offers an in-depth analysis beyond simple allowance or denial, providing nuanced insights and information about transaction legitimacy.

### Trust Score Levels

Trust scores range from `0` to `5`. A trust score of `0` indicates limited information and the lowest level of trust. Additionally, the API provides eight other flags to help assess user profiles and determine appropriate actions:

- Email deliverability
- Proxy usage
- VPN usage
- Tor usage
- Recent abusive behavior

> Every company has a unique target audience, so you might achieve better results by flagging or blocking entities with low trust scores and recent abuse instances.
