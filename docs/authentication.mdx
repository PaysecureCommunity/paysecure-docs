# Authentication

To access the API, you need to acquire your unique API key from the **Merchant Dashboard** under the **API Keys** section in your account. Ensure that you use this key as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header for every request you send.

## Authorization Header

```http
Authorization: Bearer {{APIKey}}
```

## Obtaining API Keys

### Sandbox API Key
To get your sandbox API key credentials:
1. Log in to your **Merchant Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
3. Enable the **Is Sandbox** option, located in the top right corner under your **Merchant Profile**.

### Live API Key
To obtain your live API key:
1. Log in to your **Merchant Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
3. Uncheck the **Is Sandbox** option in the top right corner under your **Merchant Profile**.
4. After unchecking, the page will refresh, allowing you to generate an API key for live transactions.

To reiterate:
- The API keys in **Sandbox mode** are for testing purposes (when **Is Sandbox** is **CHECKED** in the top right corner under the **Merchant Profile**).
- The **Live API key credentials** are used for processing actual card transactions in **Live mode** (when **Is Sandbox** is **UNCHECKED** in the same location).

Use the appropriate API key based on the environment you are working in.
