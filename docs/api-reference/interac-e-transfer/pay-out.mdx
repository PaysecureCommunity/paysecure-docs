title: "Interac e-Transfer PayOut API"
id: pay-out
description: "API for processing payouts using Interac e-Transfer in Canada."
openapi: "pay-out-openapi POST /payout"
---

## How It Works

To initiate a payout, the merchant has to provide Fundstream with the PIX details, including the recipient's PIX key (e.g., CPF/CNPJ, phone number, or email), amount, and any additional information.

If the merchant has enough balance, the transaction amount will be deducted from the merchant's balance and sent to the user.

---

## Key Steps

### Flow

#### **Initiation:**
- **User initiates:** The process starts with a user requesting a payout from the merchant.
- **Merchant approval:** If everything is OK, the merchant approves the payout request.

#### **Processing:**
- **Payment details:** Using Fundstream’s API, the merchant provides the recipient's Pix key (which can be a phone number, email, CPF/CNPJ, or random key) and the transfer amount.
- **Funds check:** Fundstream verifies if sufficient funds are available in the merchant's account to cover the transfer.
- **Processing & Key mapping:** The recipient's Pix key is validated using the DICT (Transactional Identifier Directory). This central database links Pix keys with users' bank accounts.

#### **Payout:**
- **Instant transfer:** If everything checks out, the payer's bank instantly transfers the funds to the recipient's bank account. The recipient typically receives confirmation messages from their respective bank about the successful transaction.
